Notebook Tutorial
-----------------

We provide a simulation notebook to test interaction between agents and the SDV when they are both controlled by a ML policy.

You can train your ML policy for simulation using our `simulation training notebook <https://github.com/woven-planet/l5kit/blob/master/examples/simulation/train.ipynb>`_ \

You can then test your ML policy for simulation using our `simulation evaluation notebook <https://github.com/woven-planet/l5kit/blob/master/examples/simulation/simulation_test.ipynb>`_ \
