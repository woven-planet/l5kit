Reinforcement Learning
======================


Notebook Tutorial
-----------------

We provide a notebook introducing our L5Kit gym-compatible closed-loop environment to test various reinforcement learning policies.

You can test your RL policy on real world data using our `gym notebook <https://github.com/lyft/l5kit/blob/master/examples/RL/gym_environment.ipynb>`_ \
