    "# Introduction to Planning for Self Driving Vehicles\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you are going to train your own ML policy to fully control an SDV. You will train your model using the Lyft Prediction Dataset and [L5Kit](https://github.com/lyft/l5kit).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before starting, please download the [Lyft L5 Prediction Dataset 2020](https://self-driving.lyft.com/level5/prediction/) and follow [the instructions](https://github.com/lyft/l5kit#download-the-datasets) to correctly organise it.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The policy will be a deep neural network (DNN) which will be invoked by the SDV to obtain the next command to execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "More in details, you will be working with a CNN architecture based on ResNet50.\n",
    "\n",
    "![model](../../docs/images/planning/model.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inputs\n",
    "The network will receive a Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) representation of the scene surrounding the SDV as the only input. This has been rasterised in a fixed grid image to comply with the CNN input. L5Kit is shipped with various rasterisers. Each one of them captures different aspects of the scene (e.g. lanes or satellite view).\n",
    "\n",
    "This input representation is very similar to the one used in the [prediction competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/lyft-motion-prediction-autonomous-vehicles/overview). Please refer to our [competition baseline notebook](../agent_motion_prediction/agent_motion_prediction.ipynb) and our [data format notebook](../visualisation/visualise_data.ipynb) if you want to learn more about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Outputs\n",
    "The network outputs the driving signals required to fully control the SDV. In particular, this is a trajectory of XY and yaw displacements which can be used to move and steer the vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "After enough training, your model will be able to drive an agent along a specific route. Among others, it will do lane-following while respecting traffic lights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now focus on how to train this model on the available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training using imitation learning\n",
    "The model is trained using a technique called *imitation learning*. We feed examples of expert driving experiences to the model and expect it to take the same actions as the driver did in those episodes. Imitation Learning is a subfield of supervised learning, in which a model tries to learn a function f: X -> Y describing given input / output pairs - one prominent example of this is image classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also the same concept we use in our [motion prediction notebook](../agent_motion_prediction/agent_motion_prediction.ipynb), so feel free to check that out too.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Imitation learning limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Imitation Learning is powerful, but it has a strong limitation. It's not trivial for a trained model to generalise well on out-of-distribution data.\n",
    "\n",
    "After training the model, we would like it to take full control and drive the AV in an autoregressive fashion (i.e. by following its own predictions).\n",
    "\n",
    "During evaluation it's very easy for errors to compound and make the AV drift away from the original distribution. In fact, during training our model has seen only good examples of driving. In particular, this means **almost perfect midlane following**. However, even a small constant displacement during evaluation can accumulate enough error to lead the AV completely out of its distribution in a matter of seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "![drifting](../../docs/images/planning/drifting.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a well known issue in SDV control and simulation discussed, among others, in [this article](https://ri.cmu.edu/pub_files/2010/5/Ross-AIStats10-paper.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Adding perturbations to the mix\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the simplest techniques to ensure a good generalisation is **data augmentation**, which exposes the network to different versions of the input and helps it to generalise better to out-of-distribution situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our setting, we want to ensure that **our model can recover if it ends up slightly off the midlane it is following**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following [the noteworthy approach from Waymo](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.03079.pdf), we can enrich the training set with **online trajectory perturbations**. These perturbations are kinematically feasible and affect both starting angle and position. A new ground truth trajectory is then generated to link this new starting point with the original trajectory end point. These starting point will be slightly rotated and off the original midlane, and the new trajectory will teach the model how to recover from this situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "![perturbation](../../docs/images/planning/perturb.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following cell, we load the training data and leverage L5Kit to add these perturbations to our training set.\n",
    "We also plot the same example with and without perturbation. During training, our model will see also those examples and learn how to recover from positional and angular offsets."
