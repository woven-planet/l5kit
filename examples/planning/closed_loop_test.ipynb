    "# Closed-Loop Evaluation\n",
    "In this notebook you are going to evaluate a CNN-based policy to control the SDV with a protocol named *closed-loop* evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: this notebook assumes you've already run the [training notebook](./train.ipynb) and stored your model successfully.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a closed-loop evaluation?\n",
    "In closed-loop evaluation the model is in **full control of the SVD**. At each time step, we predict the future trajectory and then move the AV to the first of the model's predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "We refer to this process with the terms **forward-simulate** or **unroll**.\n",
    "\n",
    "![closed-loop](../../images/planning/closed-loop.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What can we use closed-loop evaluation for?\n",
    "Closed-loop is crucial to assess the real performance of a model. **Ideally, we would test the model on the road in the real world**. However, this is clearly very expensive and scales poorly. Forward-simulation is an attempt to evaluate the system in a setting which is as close as possible to a real road test on the same route.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differently from the open-loop, the model is now in full control of the SVD and predictions are used to compute the future location of the SVD.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Is closed-loop evaluation enough?\n",
    "Closed-loop evaluation is an important step forward towards evaluating how our policy would perform on the road. However, it still have some limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The critical one is the **non-reactivity of other traffic participants**. In fact, while the SVD is now controlled by our policy, other actors are still being replayed from the original log. In this setting, a chasing car will not slow down if our policy choses a different speed profile for the SVD, resulting in a rear collision that wouldn't obviously occur in the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, closed-loop evaluation is only effective for the first few seconds of forward simulation."

    "- we **forward the current frame** to our policy;\n",
    "- we **get the predicted trajectory** from the model;\n",
    "- we **compute our metrics**;\n",

    "\n",
    "## Closed-loop metrics\n",
    "In this setting **metrics are particularly challenging**. In fact, we would like to penalise some of the simulation drift (e.g. going off road or in the opposite lane) while at the same time allow others (e.g. different speed profiles).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collisions\n",
    "Our SVD should avoid collisions with other agents.In this simple example, we won't distinguish between collisions caused by non-reactivity of other agents and actual collisions, and we will simply report them all categorised by where they occurred (front, rear and side with respect to the AV).\n",

    "However, if we only considered collisions, our SVD could pass all tests by simply driving off-road or in a different lane.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distance from reference trajectory\n",
    "To address the issue presented above, we require our SVD to loosely stick to the original trajectory in the data. By setting the right threshold on the distance we can allow for different speed profile and small steerings, while pensalising large deviations like driving off-road.\n",
