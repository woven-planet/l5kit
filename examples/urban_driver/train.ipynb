    "# Introduction to Urban Driver\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you are going to train the planner introduced in [Urban Driver: Learning to Drive from Real-world Demonstrations Using Policy Gradients](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ibktAcINCaj).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will train your model using the Woven by Toyota Prediction Dataset and [L5Kit](https://github.com/woven-planet/l5kit).\n",
    "**Before starting, please download the [Woven by Toyota Prediction Dataset 2020](https://woven.toyota/en/prediction-dataset) and follow [the instructions](https://github.com/woven-planet/l5kit#download-the-datasets) to correctly organise it.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model\n",
    "\n",
    "From the paper:\n",
    "```\n",
    "We use a graph neural network for parametrizing our policy.\n",
    "It combines a PointNet-like architecture for local inputs processing followed by an attention mechanism for global reasoning. In contrast to VectorNet, we use points instead of vectors. Given the set of points corresponding to each input element, we employ 3 PointNet layers to calculate a 128-dimensional feature descriptor. Subsequently, a single layer of scaled dot-product attention performs global feature aggregation, yielding the predicted trajectory. [...] In total, our model contains around 3.5 million trainable parameters, and training takes 30h on 32 Tesla V100 GPUs. For more details we refer to Appendix C.\n",
    "```\n",
    "We also report a diagram of the full model:\n",
    "\n",
    "![model](../../docs/images/urban_driver/model.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inputs\n",
    "Urban Driver is based on a vectorized representation of the world. From the paper:\n",
    "```\n",
    "We define the state as the whole set of static and dynamic elements the model receive as input. Each element is composed of a variable number of points, which can represent both time (e.g. for agents) and space (e.g. for lanes). The number of features per point depends on the element type. We pad all features to a fixed size F to ensure they can share the first fully connected layer. We include all elements up to the listed maximal number in a circular FOV of radius 35m around the SDV. Note that for performance and simplicity we only execute this query once, and then unroll within this world state.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In more details:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| State element(s) | Elements per state | Points per element | Point features description                                                               |\n",
    "|------------------|--------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| SDV              | 1                  | 4                  | SDV's X, Y and yaw pose of the current time step, as well as previous timesteps          |\n",
    "| Agents           | up to 30           | 4                  | other agents' X, Y and yaw poses of the current time step, as well as previous timesteps |\n",
    "| Lanes mid        | up to 30           | 20                 | interpolated X, Y points of the lanes' center lines, with optional traffic light signals |\n",
    "| Lanes left       | up to 30           | 20                 | interpolated X, Y points of the left lane boundaries                                     |\n",
    "| Lanes right      | up to 30           | 20                 | interpolated X, Y points of the right lane boundaries                                    |\n",
    "| Crosswalks       | up to 20           | up to 20           | crosswalks' polygon boundaries - X, Y                                                    |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Outputs\n",
    "Urban Driver outputs the next positions and orientations of the SDV. Each timestep is a tuple consisting of `(X, Y, yaw)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training in closed loop\n",
    "One of the main features of Urban Driver is how it is trained; from the paper:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[...] we then train a policy network in closed-loop employing policy gradients.\n",
    "We train our proposed method on 100 hours of expert demonstrations on urban roads and show that it learns complex driving policies that generalize well and can perform a variety of driving maneuvers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When training in closed-loop, the model does not predict all timesteps at once, but instead predicts one action at a time and use that action to perform a step in the surrounding environment before repeating the process. This allows the model to capture how the environment evolves as it takes decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare Figure 3 from the original paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "![model](../../docs/images/urban_driver/method.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "One iteration of policy gradient update. Given a real-world expert trajectory we sample a policy state by unrolling the policy for T steps. We then compute optimal policy update by backpropagation through time.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Closed-loop training has two major advantages:\n",
    "- reducing the domain shift between training and evaluation;\n",
    "- replacing hand-crafted off-policy perturbations with on-policy perturbations generated by the model itself\n",
    "\n",
    "Again from the paper:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[...] reports performance when all methods are trained to optimize the imitation loss alone. Behavioral cloning yields a high number of trajectory errors and collisions. This is expected, as this approach is known to suffer from the issue of covariate shift \n",
    "```"
